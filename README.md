# RoutesByPlayers
## For servers that don't want their players to travel for hours, but still want to keep distance a factor.
by ColonelKai and with help of MoseMister (as always)

### How does it work?

Players can set up Nodes (think of them like airports, bus stops etc.) Owners of 2 nodes (or the same player if he has two nodes) can set up a "route" between these two. Now, any player who comes to a node can warp to the other. Every node requires upkeep which is determined by the amount of routes it has and the distance of each route. Owners can also decide to add costs to the routes.

### What does this add to your server?
Well first of all, as the slogan suggests, the problem of transportation being boring while trying to keep the distance a factor is solved. During wars, for example, the owners of nodes of the two nation could terminate the route in-between, making transportation a problem in a place where people are willing to take the time. 
The fact that longer routes = more upkeep also contributes to the economy, as the owners of nodes will price different routes differently depending on their distance, and if a route with little usage to a far-away place may be abandoned in favour of a detour to a central hub. This also leads to the creation of hub nodes! 
### What can you configure?
- Use vault currency instead of items for upkeep/travel fees.
- Use whatever item you want for upkeep/travel fees.
- Change the multiplier on how much item/currency is taken as upkeep per distance.
- Option to make all node locations public 
- Option to put all nodes onto Dynmap if installed.
